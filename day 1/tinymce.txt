Today, I have learnt about the Tinymce, which is used as a library plugins for writing HTML type editor in webapplication's admin panel.
  In my case, I was searching how can I edit django textField in admin panel, and I got to know about tinymce.
  how can one install on django:
  
  1. pip install django-tinymce

  2. Add tinymce to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py for your project:

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'tinymce',
    ...
)
  
 3. Add tinymce.urls to urls.py for your project:

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...
    path('tinymce/', include('tinymce.urls')),
    ...
)
  4. In models.py

  from tinymce.models import HTMLField

  description = HTMLField()

  5. In template file eg. actor.html
    {{ actor.description|safe }}
And Voila, we can have the editor inside our admin panel for description instead of using just textField.
